//! Per-display autopause: decode the consumer's `window_state` bitmask
//! into an "autopause requested?" boolean and apply the resume debounce
//! that smooths bursty fullscreen toggles.
//!
//! The router owns the per-display [`State`] machine; this module is
//! pure logic + bit constants. `decide` mirrors the modes of the old
//! KDE wallpaper plugin's `Common.PauseMode` (now `AutopauseMode`),
//! and the resume debounce mirrors the old `playTimer` — pause is
//! immediate, but resuming is delayed by `resume_ms` so a brief flag
//! drop doesn't flap the renderer.
